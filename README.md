# ConveyorBelt-Repository

This repository covers the process of modeling, designing, 3D printing and developing the Arduino control code for a small-scale conveyor belt to demonstrate how PID controllers work. 

- Mathematical Modeling of DC Motors
- Obtaining and Analyzing the Model's Transfer Function
- Obtaining the PID Controller constants
- Design and Modeling for 3D Printing
- Design and assembly of physical conveyor belt hardware

Below you can see the modeling project and the final 3D print of the conveyor belt. The project code is also available in the other files in this repository for you to consult.
